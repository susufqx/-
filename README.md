# A calculator 
This is a very simple programme of calculator which can be run in the Mac OS.

It is written by objective-c and the views are designed by the new tools of Xcode named Mainstoryboard. 
So there is no code in the file which descripes the graphics of the programme. 

I'm the starter of the development of iOS or Mac OS and I have learnd to use Xcode for developer the applications by the languages objective-c or swift since the second semester of the second year of the period engineering school in France. It is about one year which is not long but not short. I have read some documents and papers on the development Apple. It need us to learn a new language which is so strange and the grammar of the language is so different with other main languages like C/C++, Java, JavaScript, Python ,C# etc. So sometiome I want to give up it but I don't do like that. This is my first programme wrriten by objective-c of Xcode. It is not complex but all the annotations are in Chinese. So I need to change them into English.

Run it in the Xcode because it is a Xcode projet.

Thank you!
